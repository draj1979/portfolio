<p>Problem-solving skills: Coding teaches children how to think logically and break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts. This helps develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills that can be applied in various aspects of life.</p>

<p>Computational thinking: Coding encourages computational thinking, which involves analyzing problems and designing solutions in a way that computers can understand. This type of thinking promotes a structured approach to problem-solving and enhances skills such as pattern recognition and algorithmic thinking.</p>

<p>Creativity and innovation: Coding empowers children to express their creativity and turn their ideas into reality. It encourages them to think outside the box, experiment, and come up with innovative solutions. Learning to code fosters a sense of empowerment and enables kids to create digital content rather than just being passive consumers.</p>
